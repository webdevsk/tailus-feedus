# Recipe App

# Description:

- You are provided with an incomplete Recipe App project that uses the free MealDB API to retrieve recipe data. The app needs to showcase some recipes and allows users to add them to a cart. Functionalities after carting is not required for the current MVP. The home page includes a banner section, a top recipes section, and a search option to find recipes by name or ingredients.

# Required New Features:

- Basic Authentication: Implement an authentication flow using name, email, phone, and a password.
- All Recipes Page: Create a page where users can view all recipes.
- Add Recipe to Cart: Allow users to add recipes to a cart. The cart should store data locally if the user is not logged in, and save it to the user’s account if they are logged in.
- Bug Fixes: There are at least three, or more features that are currently not working properly. Identify and fix these bugs.

# Additional Requirements:

- Consistent Design Style: Ensure that any new features match the design style of the existing application. Follow basic accessibility standards.
- Mobile Responsiveness: Make all pages responsive for mobile devices.

# Documentation Requirements:

- After completion, document under the README section.
- Features Implemented: Describe the new features you added, in both technical and non-technical terms.
- Bug Fixes: Briefly list the bugs you identified and fixed.
- Time Estimate: Indicate the total time spent on the assessment.

# N.B. Documentation should be brief and short, no need to go overboard with it.
